Introduction (Text copied from UCI HAR dataset - Features_info.txt):

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Subjects:
The data retrieved from the UCI HAR dataset included measurements taken on 30 individuals.  An identifier (1:30) is provided to delineate these individuals.

Activities:
Data was collected for each of the 30 Subjects performing a basic set of self-descriptive activities.  Each of these activities produces data for every one of the features above.
- Sitting
- Standing
- Laying
- Walking
- Walking Upstairs
- Walking Downstairs
Each Activity is also ascribed a numerical value as part of the name (1:6) as this data was included as part of the original dataset and may be indicative of process.  It was determined that removing this from the label was unnecessary and may in fact remove data which may be useful at some future point.
